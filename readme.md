Video Game Design with Godot
---

## About this repository
This repository contains the code and kits for VGD @ Coyote Central. It is a
monorepo of a handful of video game design kits in line with a few popular video
game genres, as well as guided tutorials or building. All projects here are built
using Godot and code is written in GDScript.

### Current Kits:
- Platformer Kit: in the vein of Mario

### Planned Kits and Roadmap:
- Top-Down Dungeon Crawler Kit
- Farm Game Kit


## How to use this repository for your class
Please ensure that the `main` branch does not contain any student files. This
should be kept as a "clean slate" branch. This will ensure that this code is
easily resesttable after each and every class.

Classes should create release branches for their work off of `main`. For example:
`release/summer-2024-week-1`. I (Dytrich) do not currently have an idea of using
the actual release feature in GitHub, so we will stick with this for now.

## Contributing to the kits
Contributions are greatly appreciated. No contribution or convention guide is
currently established. If you are considering refactoring, consider opening
an issue/discussion for posterity so we can document better practices for
building out scalable games in Godot!
